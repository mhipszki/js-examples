# JavaScript examples

This repo contains JavaScript examples to cover a few important topics of the language.

The examples can be run by executing the IFEE functions e.g.

```
// object
(function showObj() {
	console.log('--- object');

	var obj = {
		key: 'some value'
	}

	console.log(obj);
	console.log('obj.key = ', obj.key);
	console.log('obj["key"] = ', obj['key']);
	console.log('\n');
})();
```

adding a `()` to the end of the function wrapped into parenthesis.

Feel free to play around with them.

NOTE: the `console.log` statements are only there to output results to stdio.

## History

I've also added a bit of history as a start with some interesting facts.

For almost 20 years since ECMAScript was born nothing really happened with the language, but there came ES2015 (ES6) last year and now ES2016 (ES7) and things are changing quite fast both in the language and the whole ecosystem, so it's better keep updated!
